As you have learned, the tide is generated by the so-called *differential pull*, meaning the difference in gravitational pull on water masses at different locations on the Earth.

    "As we can see, the differences are very subtle (in the order of 10^-7 g). We also know that the gravitational pull is responsible for the Earth's rotation around the Sun. That would imply, however, that the rotation of the Earth varies over its body, along with the gravitational pull. Yet, we know that the Earth rotates around the Sun as a whole. Apparently, the Earth compensates for these subtle differences in gravitational pull so it can rotate around the Sun as one body. The water masses on the surface of the solid Earth, however, can move around and are not as fixed and rigid as the solid land masses. So, while the solid masses of the Earth remain virtually unchanged, its water masses are moved around by these subtle differences in gravitational pull.\n",

    "So, let's visualize these differences. Earth's rotation is based on the gravitational pull that acts on its center, hence this will be our *reference pull*. For the other locations around the Earth, we will compute the difference to the reference pull, by subtracting the reference pull from the gravitational pull at each location. If we do this with the actual forces we computeed above we won't see the difference since they are very small. Therefore, we will visualize the forces out of proportion, i.e. we exaggerate the difference. Next to the difference in magnitude, there are also slight differences in the direction of the forces at different positions, as each force is directed towards the centre of the sun/moon. We will also visualize these out of proportion, so we can actually see the difference. Run the code cell below to get a visualization of the forces we talked about above."

    "Still, both are several orders of magnitude smaller than the Earth's own attraction towards its centre, g. That means, that the component of the differential pull that is in line with Earth's center can be neglected, since its magnitude is negligible compared to g, and will therefore not make a noticable difference. The only thing we are left with then, are the *tangential components* of the differential pull. These are the forces that generate the tide by moving the water around the surface of the Earth. This results in the two bulges of water at either side of the Earth, in line with the Sun/Moon. Hence, if the Sun and Moon are aligned (full moon and new moon), the forces enhance each other and we get a spring tide (larger tidal range). On the other hand, if they are perpendicular to each other (1st and 3rd quarter moon), the lunar and solar differential pull work against each other and we get a neap tide.

    "## 2. Tidal constituents\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above exercise, we looked at the generation of an equilibrium tide for an Earth that is entirely covered by water, and who's gravitational field is only affected by itself, the Sun, and the Moon. In reality, our planet has continents, oceans with varying water depths, and a complex gravitational field. Hence the tidal signals we actually observe around the planet are more complex as well. Fortunately, we can break them down into multiple harmonic components, called *tidal constituents*. These can either be diurnal, semi-diurnal, short-, or long-period constituents. Each constituent is characterized by an amplitude, frequency and phase, and individually looks like a smooth sin/cosine curve. When we sum up all the individual components we get complex tidal signals, with spring-neap cycles, daily inequalities, and longer-term variations. To visualize this, we will compute the tidal signal at four different locations around the World: Scheveningen (Netherlands), Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), Galveston (Texas USA), and Jakarta (Indonesia). To do this, we will use seven harmonic components: M2, S2, K2, K1, O1, P1, and M4. Section 3.7.6. in the book gives some more information on each constituent.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's have a look at the amplitudes of the constituents at each location. They are proved in the table below, in cm. Can you already determine which components will be dominant at the different locations? Also, take a look at the main lunar (M2) and solar (S2) components. In the previous exercise we determined that the lunar tide should be around 2.3 times the solar tide. Does that apply at the four locations? If not, can you think of reasons why the ratio would be different?\n",

    "In the code below we load the data (phase and amplitude of each constituent) and plot the tidal signal at each location. For each location, the individual components are plotted (upper plot, colors) and then the combined tidal signal (lower plot, black). It is an interactive plot, you can adjust the plotted time range using the slider (from 1 day to 1 year), and you can select which tidal constituents should be plotted with the tick boxes. This way you can play around with the different constituents and see what kind of signal you get. Try to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set the time range to around 30 days and select only the main semi-diurnal components (M2 and S2). Which phenomenon can you detect when looking at the combined signal of these two? What is the period of this combined signal (in days)?\n",

Plot only the M2 and M4 components and take a look at Scheveningen (you can see it better if you decrease the time range a bit further). What do you see there? Can you explain this? And why is Scheveningen different than the rest?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The combinations we looked at above have periods up to 2 weeks. But we also know that there are much longer variations. Set the time-range to 1 year and plot the combinations S2/K2 and K1/P1. What kind of combined signal can you see now? Compute the periods.\n",

    "<!-- 4. Now have a look at the triangle figure below. It shows the two main diurnal and semi-diurnal components along with their periods in days. Further up the triangle, we can fill in the period of the harmonic combinations (e.g. the combined signal of the M2 and S2 has a period of 14.77 days). Can you derive the periods of the other combinations using the figure? You can also compute the periods with a formula, think back to wave groups (section 3.5.3 in the book). -->\n",
