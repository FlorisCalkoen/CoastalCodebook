You can assess the impact of phase differences and the amplitudes on the asymmetry on skewness in the interactive graph below. The figures 5.13 and 5.16 of the book can be reproduced with this figure, without scaling the y-axis. What are the amplitudes and the phases of wave component 1 and 2 to reproduce these figures? You can check it below the graph.\n",

    "Later in this course we will consider how wave shape influences sediment transport. Sediment transport is proportional to higher powers of the orbital velocity signal, so as a first step, let us consider what higher powers of the surface elevation look like. Remember that under a progressive wave (like we see in the nearshore), velocity and surface elevation are in phase. Here we compare eta with $\\eta^3$ when we vary the phase of the first harmonic component, as in Figure 5.14 and 5.17. How do the peaks in  $\\eta^3$ change? What might this mean for the corresponding velocity signal and direction of sediment transport?”"
