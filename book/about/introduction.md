Introduction
=======================

The interactive exercises of the Coastal Codebook are meant to be used alongside the Coastal Textbook and aim to enhance your understanding of the textbook material. We therefore advise to work on these notebooks during your weekly self-study time. We will also try to connect to the notebooks in the lectures. During the Friday tutorials, which are guided by the teaching assistants, you can continue to work on the notebooks. So make sure you bring your questions about the notebooks (and any other content related questions) to the tutorials.

Please note that the final notebooks per week will be released at the beginning of each week.
