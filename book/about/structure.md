## Notebook overview

- 1_coastal_classification: on tectonic and process-based classification of coasts
- 2a_pre_knowledge_waves: to test your knowledge on the dispersion relationship, not needed if you master your Waves course material
- 2b_wave_dispersion_and_grouping: practice a bit more with wave dispersion and study wave grouping (largely known from Waves, repeated in this week's lectures)
- 2c_theory_equilibrium_tide: a review of the origin of the tide (differential pull of the sun and moon) as discussed in this week's reading material and lectures, handy if you find this a difficult topic
- 2d_tidal_constituents: get to know the tide, tidal propagation and tidal constituents
- 3a_tidal_environments: discover the four different tidal environments
- 3b_wave_asymmetry_and_skewness: recreate the figures in the book about skewed and asymmetric waves
- 3c_radiation_stresses_and_wave_forces: cross-shore distribution of cross-shore and alongshore wave forces
- 4a_bound_long_wave: understand the bound long wave forced by a wave group
- 4b_shallow_water_tides: recognize shallow-water tides and do a tidal prediction
- 5_coastal_impact_beach_states
- 6_cross_shore_transport
- 7_alongshore_transport
- 8_tidal_basins
