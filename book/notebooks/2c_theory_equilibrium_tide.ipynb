As you have learned, the tide is generated by the so-called <b>differential pull</b>, meaning the difference in gravitational pull on water masses at different locations on the Earth as compared to the gravitational pull for the centre of the earth. To make calculations, we first need a function that can compute the gravitational pull between two celestial bodies (e.g. the Earth and Moon)."

    "As we can see, the differences are very subtle (in the order of 10^-7 $g$). We also know that the gravitational pull is responsible for the Earth's rotation around the Sun. That would imply, however, that the rotation of the Earth varies over its body, along with the gravitational pull. Yet, we know that the Earth rotates around the Sun as a whole. Apparently, the Earth compensates for these subtle differences in gravitational pull so it can rotate around the Sun as one body. The water masses on the surface of the solid Earth, however, can move around and are not as fixed and rigid as the solid land masses. So, while the solid masses of the Earth remain virtually unchanged, its water masses are moved around by these subtle differences in gravitational pull.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, let's visualize these differences. Earth's rotation is based on the gravitational pull that acts on its center, hence this will be our **reference pull**. For the other locations around the Earth, we will compute the difference from the reference pull, by subtracting the reference pull from the gravitational pull at each location. If we do this with the actual forces we computed above, we won't see the difference since they are very small. Therefore, we will visualize the forces out of proportion, i.e., we exaggerate the difference. Next to the difference in magnitude, there are also slight differences in the direction of the forces at different positions, as each force is directed towards the centre of the Sun/Moon. We will also visualize these out of proportion, so we can actually see the difference. Run the code cell below to get a visualization of the forces we talked about above."

    "Still, both are several orders of magnitude smaller than the Earth's own attraction towards its centre, $g$. That means, that the component of the differential pull that is in line with Earth's center (perpendicular to the Earth's surface) can be neglected, since its magnitude is negligible compared to $g$, and will therefore not make a noticable difference. The only thing we are left with then, are the *tangential components* of the differential pull. These are the forces that generate the tide by moving the water around the surface of the Earth. This results in the two bulges of water at either side of the Earth, in line with the Sun/Moon. Hence, if the Sun and Moon are aligned (full moon and new moon), the forces enhance each other and we get a spring tide (larger tidal range). On the other hand, if they are perpendicular to each other (1st and 3rd quarter moon), the lunar and solar differential pull work against each other and we get a neap tide. In the figure below you can play around with different constellations of the Moon and Sun, to see what the effect is on the total tidal shape.\n",

You can adjust the position of the Moon by setting its angle relative to the position of the sun.
