# Issues

If you have a question about the installation process or notebooks, feel free to open an
issue in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/FlorisCalkoen/CoastalCodebook). If
that's your first time, have a look at [these
instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue).
We choose to use the GitHub issue-tracker because your fellow students probably have
similar problems. We will not troubleshoot the tutorial notebooks by email.
