# Welcome to Coastal Codebook 

Coastal Dynamics discusses the interrelation between physical wave, flow, and sediment transport phenomena and the resulting morphodynamics of a wide variety of coastal systems. The objective is to provide insights into the phenomenological and theoretical as well as applied aspects for civil engineering MSc students. It builds upon the BSc and MSc courses treating the dynamics of flow, wave, and sediment transport, and forms the basis for the Coastal Engineering B-module (B1, CIEM3210). 

Explanation on Coastal Codebook as a workbook with the Coastal Dynamics Open Textbook (link) and the Coastal Systems Course. Explain link to lectures and tutorial at DUT and refer to Brightspace. How to use the workbook to work independently and how to prepare for lectures and tutorials (general, not per week).
