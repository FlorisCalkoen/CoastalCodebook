# You can also create content with Jupyter Notebooks. This means that you can include
# code blocks and their outputs in your book.
# 
# ## Markdown + notebooks
# 
# As it is markdown, you can embed images, HTML, etc into your posts!

# \begin{aligned}
# \mbox{mean} la_{tex} \\ \\

# 
# ## MyST markdown
# 
# MyST markdown works in Jupyter Notebooks as well. For more information about MyST markdown, check
# out [the MyST guide in Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/content/myst.html),
# or see [the MyST markdown documentation](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
# 
# ## Code blocks and outputs
# 
# Jupyter Book will also embed your code blocks and output in your book.
# For example, here's some sample Matplotlib code:

# In[1]:


import os
import pathlib
import sys

# Make coastmonitor library importable by appending root to path
cwd = pathlib.Path().resolve()
sys.path.append(str(cwd.parent))

from utils.geometries import geo_bbox
