similar problems. We will not troubleshoot the tutorial notebooks by email.

Do you run into an issue with the installation or notebook execution? Don't worry, it's
likely that other students have come across similar hurdles. To encourage a collaborative learning
environment and build a comprehensive knowledge base, we strongly encourage you to share
your questions or issues by opening an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/FlorisCalkoen/CoastalCodebook).

## Why Open an Issue?

**Avoid Duplication**: By documenting your problem and the solution on GitHub, you help prevent repeated queries and enable others to benefit from the resolution.
**Improve the Resource**: Your contributions through issues help us identify and fix bugs, leading to improvements in the course material for everyone.

## How to Open an Issue

If you're unfamiliar with the process of creating an issue on GitHub, [here is a helpful guide](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue) that walks you through the steps. It's a simple process that involves:

1. Navigating to the Issues Tab: Click on the 'Issues' tab in the repository.
2. Creating a New Issue: Use the 'New Issue' button to start.
3. Describing the Problem: Provide a clear and concise description of what the issue is,
   including steps to reproduce it, expected outcomes, and any screenshots if applicable.

Please note that we prioritize the GitHub issue tracker for all troubleshooting and support queries. Direct email requests related to tutorial notebooks will not be addressed. This approach ensures transparency, accessibility, and efficiency in resolving issues.
