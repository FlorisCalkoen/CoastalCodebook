    "Welcome to the first notebook exercise of Coastal Systems (TU Delft, MSc Coastal Engineering)! This is only the second year that we experiment with notebooks in Coastal Systems. With these notebooks we hope to support the textbook with interactive material that helps you better understand the coastal processes and concepts explained in this course. Please let us know how you find the notebooks - we appreciate your feedback!\n",

    "Chapter 2 of [Coastal Dynamics Open Textbook](https://textbooks.open.tudelft.nl/textbooks/catalog/view/37/92/383-1) describes the large geographical variation of coasts across the world. It explains how the coasts that we have today are shaped by both present-day processes and processes millions years ago. It distinguishes between three different order of features, which are associated to different orders of of time. In this notebook we will look at coastal systems at these different orders of scale. "

The dataset we load contains a sample (10\\%) of observed eartquakes between Jan 2000 and Dec 2018. Why earthquake data?

    "One of the most useful skills that a modern coastal engineer can have is being able to interpret satellite imagery. What can we learn about coasts from remote sensing? How can we apply what we learned in Chapter 2 about coastal classification? When you look at these images, consider the following checklist:\n",
    " - Where is your site with respect to plate boundaries? (leading, trailing)\n",
    " - Is there evidence of past RSLR rise, fall, or stability?\n",
    " - Is there evidence of glaciation?\n",
    " - What are the dominant hydrodynamic processes and sediment sources (wave/tide/river)?\n",
    " - Primary/secondary coastal forms? (See Table 2.3)\n",
    " - What kind of sediment is present (sand/mud/other)? How much?\n",
    " - What kind of biotic or human influences do you see?\n",
