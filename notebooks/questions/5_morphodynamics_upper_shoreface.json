            "a": "less than 33 km",
            "b": "between 33 km and 74 km",

        "feedback": {
            "correct": "Correct, earthquakes at diverging boundaries typically occur at shallower depths",
            "incorrect": "Incorrect. Note that at diverging boundaries the tectonic plates move away from each other. Magma wells up to (relatively) shallow depths in order to fill the gap. This may cause earthquakes. Where are these earthquakes likeliest to occur?"
