With these notebooks we hope to provide you with interactive course material that helps you better understand the processes and concepts that we teach in this course. Please let us know how you find the notebooks - we appreciate your feedback!\n",

It explains how the coasts that we have today are shaped by both present-day processes and processes millions years ago. It distinguishes between three different order of features, which are associated to different orders of of time. In this notebook we will look at coastal systems at these different orders of scale. "

    "In this notebook we will start with the broadest (or first order) features of the coast that cover large geographical distances (thousands of kilometres) and are linked to the long-term geological process of plate tectonics. We will do so by using earthquake data from the [USGS](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/search/). The dataset we load contains a sample (10\\%) of observed eartquakes between Jan 2000 and Dec 2018. Why earthquake data?
