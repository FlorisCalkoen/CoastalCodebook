    "Both the water depth and the wave period influence the wave propagation speed, as we have seen in the previous question. In deep water, the depth is so large relative to the wavelength that the orbital velocities of the wave do not reach the bottom and no interaction between the waves and the bed is possible. In this case, the wave celerity is only affected by the wave period. The other extreme is in shallow water, where only the water depth influences the wave celerity, and the wave period is irrelevant (non-dispersive waves). Thus, two waves of different periods but at the same location have the same celerity if both waves meet the requirements for shallow water conditions. Only if the water depth for one or both of these waves is classified as intermediate or deep water, the waves have a different celerity. \n",
    "\n",
    "The wave celerity and the wavelength change when waves propagate in the cross-shore direction. In the interactive graph below you can study the impact of changing the bed slope (1:x) and the water depth (at the most seaward point) on the three waves (components). Here you will see that waves might have a different water depth classification (deep/intermediate/shallow) at the same time and location. Below the graph are a few practical questions that assess the effect of wave period, depth, and bathymetry on the wavelength and period."
