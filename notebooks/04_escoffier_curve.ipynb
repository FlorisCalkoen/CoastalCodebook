    "# Coastal Systems Notebook 4: Escoffier curve\n",
    "\n",
    "In chapter 9 of the [Coastal Dynamics Open Textbook](https://textbooks.open.tudelft.nl/textbooks/catalog/view/37/92/383-1), we learned about tidal inlets and their stability. Tidal inlets are very dynamic and their stability depends on a lot of factors. Escoffier was the first to study the stability of tidal inlets. More specifically, he studied the cross-sectional area of tidal inlets as they change throughout the tidal cycle. From his studies, Escoffier developed the now well-known Escoffier curve. In this notebook we will use an interactive approach to better understand the Escoffier curve. Afterwards you are tasked to answer some questions to verify your knowledge on the topic.\n",

    "Escoffierâ€™s curve is a so-called closure curve and describes the relationship between maximum channel velocity $u_e$ and the parameter $X$, which is primarily, but not solely, a function of the channel cross-section. If we consider a sinusoidal tidal velocity signal:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "u_e = \\hat{u}_e = \\frac{\\pi P}{A_e T}\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\hat{u}_e$ is the tidal signal amplitude, $P$ the tidal prism, $A_e$ the channel cross-section and $T$ the tidal period (see Intermezzo 9.4 of the book, equation 9.5).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The process that leads to the Escoffier curve is explained in the book. In this notebook we provide a short visualisation, see the interactive plot below. We start with an imaginary channel cross-section that is very small, close to point A, such that the tidal difference in the estuary is smaller than the tidal range. Increasing the cross-section ($A_e$) results in an increase of the tidal prism ($P$) so large that $u_e$ increases too (recall eq. 9.5). At some point the tidal difference in the estuary is equal to the tidal range and we reach the peak of the closure curve. A larger cross-section now reduces $u_e$ as $P$ remains constant (again, recall eq. 9.5)."
