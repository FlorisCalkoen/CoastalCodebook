    "1) How do the earthquake magnitude and earthquake depth relate to the coasts that we see? (Hint: See Figure 2.3 in the textbook and consider how deep under the ground the plates are moving. Extra hint: How do earthquake magnitude and depth differ for convergent and divergent plate boundaries?)\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Earthquake data support one of the most fundamental processes in the geology: plate tectonics. Although plate tectonics is a relatively slow process that acts on the [geological time scale](https://cdn.britannica.com/67/73167-050-B9A74092/chart.jpg), it has had an enormous impact on the formation of coastlines and determines the broadest features of the coast. What are two important inherited aspects of this process? (Hint: see Figure 2.10 and Sec. 2.3.3 in the textbook.) \n",
    "\n",
    "3) In 1971 Inman, D. L. & Nordstrom, C. E. used plate tectonics to classify the coast. Explain the classification that they introduced. What are the three different classes that they distinguish? How do they match with the earthquake data as you can explore in the panel? \n",

    "4) Can you identify or predict areas around the world where you will find the coasts that are distinguished by Inman, D. L. & Nordstrom, C. E.? For instance, what kind of coasts do you have in Chili? And how are they different to the east coast of the USA? And what is characteristic about the East China sea? \n",

    "5) Inman, D. L. & Nordstrom (1971) further distinguish Afro-trailing-edge coasts and Amero-trailing-edge coasts based on differences in sediment supplies. What is the main cause of these differences in sediment supply? And how do you expect the differences in sediment input to show in the coastal geomorphology?\n",

    "1. Find and compare a heavily engineered river-dominated delta and a more natural river-dominated delta\n",
    "2. Compare the scale of the biggest and smallest tidal basin in the dataset\n",

    "4. Compare and contrast wave-dominated deltas with high and low sediment supply. How can you tell?\n",
    "5. Find a tidal estuary with large fine (muddy) sediment supply, then find one with a large coarse (sandy) sediment supply. How can you tell the difference?\n",
    "6. The eastern and western tips of the Dutch and German Wadden Islands are very different beach ridge environments. How might differences in sediment supply explain this? Where is the sediment coming from?\n",
    "7. The Dune du Pilat in France is one of the world's largest coastal sand dunes (it is also one of the coolest and you should definitely visit if you get the chance!). Why is it located on the east side of Arcachon Inlet and not the west?\n",
    "8. Look at the northern Jiangsu coast in China. What might explain the limited sediment supply in this location?\n",
    "9. Find an estuary or tidal bay with extensive intertidal flats. Do you see salt marshes or mangrove forests nearby?  Why or why not?\n",
    "10. Find an inlet with jetties. How might this affect the way it evolves?\n",
    "11. Find a delta/estuary/inlet whose shape is constrained by the presence of rocky coastal features.  \n",
    "12. The Albufeira Lagoon in Portugal opens and closes seasonally. In the image shown, is it open or closed? When and how might it open or close? \n",
    "13. Find examples of heavily urbanized estuaries. How might these human interventions influence the natural processes there?\n",
    "14. Based on these satellite images, which is the most beautiful site? Taking a moment to appreciate the beauty of these natural systems is an important part of your job as coastal engineers.\n",
