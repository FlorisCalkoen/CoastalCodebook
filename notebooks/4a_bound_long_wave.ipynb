We will continue here on the functions you made in week 2, for this wave envelope (envelope_t and envelope_x). Can you paste these in the envelope_eta_t and envelope_eta_x below? The envelope_eta_t(t) will describe the time series of the wave envelope, while the envelope_eta_x(x) will be used to calculate the surface elevation along a spatial axis.

    "Due to the wave height variations in the group, the wave energy and radiation stresses vary in the group. This also that the set-down in the shoaling zone varies within the group, with the larger set-down under the higher waves in the group. This results in a mean water level fluctuation on the scale of the wave group with the largest depression under the highest waves in the group. This leads to a long wave motion, the so-called bound long wave, which is forced by the group and travels at the speed of this group. For a perfect bound long wave, the phase-shift between the long wave and the short-wave envelope is $\\pi$ ; the wave trough of the bound long waves coincides with the maximum of the wave envelope. This negative correlation changes to a positive correlation as the waves enter the surf zone. This can be understood from intermittent wave-breaking in the group, generating a time-varying set-up. See also section 5.8.2 in the textbook.\n",
