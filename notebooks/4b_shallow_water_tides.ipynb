    "# Shallow Water Tides\n",
    "\n",
    "Building upon our previous analysis of tidal characters and main tidal constituents, this notebook delves into Chapter 5 of the textbook, where you gained insights into tidal propagation in coastal waters and higher harmonic tidal constituents. Here, our primary focus will be on ***shallow-water tides***, also known as ***overtides***, explained in chapter 5.7.5 of the textbook.\n",
    "Shallow-water tides are generated as a result of non-linear effects in shallow coastal waters and tidal basins. Unlike the basic astronomical constituents driven by tidal forces from the Earth, Moon, and Sun, shallow-water tides have periods that are integer fractions (1/2, 1/3, etc.) of these basic periods. This characteristic gives them the name overtides. We will not repeat the whole theory here, so make sure you followed these weeks lectures and Chapter 5 of the textbook. Some of the overtides are:\n",
    "- M2 higher harmonics: M3, M4, M6, M8\n",
    "- S2 higher harmonics: S4, S6, S8\n",
    "- Tides generated by interaction of different tidal components: MS4, MN4\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore overtides using python code and introduce a new method of obtaining the tidal signal and making tidal predictions. Therefore, please import the libraries that we need for the analysis from the cell below.\n"

    "Because the tide is caused by regular astronomical phenomena, it can be predicted accurately a long time ahead (although not including meteorological effects such as storm surges). While we've utilized global model data from FES2014 in our previous analyses, it's important to note that the tidal signal at a particular location can also be derived from measured sea levels through harmonic analysis.\n",

It is a unified tidal analysis framework used for carrying out tidal analysis on a multi-year sequence of observations collected at irregularly spaced times.
