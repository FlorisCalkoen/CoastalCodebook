Secondly, let's assume that the wave climate is given by the conditions described above (for which we already calculated the total yearly transport. We also need to impose initial and boundary conditions. These are thoroughly described by Equation 8.21 - 8.23. Briefly, for initial conditions, we assume a horizontal coastline (i.e $y=0$  along the coast). The following two boundary conditions are imposed:\n",
