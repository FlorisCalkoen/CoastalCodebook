    "## Introduction\n",
    "Remember from chapter 5 that the velocity $u$ close to the bed can be assumed to consist of a wave group-averaged component $\\bar{u}$, a short-wave-averaged oscillatory component $u_{lo}$ and a short-wave oscillatory component $u_{hi}$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "u = \\bar{u} + u_{lo} + u_{hi}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "We are interested in the time-averaged sediment transport. We have used the third odd velocity moment as a proxy for the bed load transport and the fourth odd velocity moment as a proxy for suspended load transport. If $\\bar{u} \\ll u_{lo} \\ll u_{hi}$, the three most important terms in the third odd velocity moment are:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\left\\langle u \\left|u\\right|^2\\right\\rangle = 3 \\left\\langle \\bar{u} \\left|u_{hi}\\right|^2\\right\\rangle + \\left\\langle u_{hi} \\left|u_{hi}\\right|^2\\right\\rangle + 3 \\left\\langle u_{lo} \\left|u_{hi}\\right|^2\\right\\rangle + ...\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Each of these terms is fully explained in the book (so you should definitely read up on this), but in short, each of these terms refers to the following process:\n",
    "* $3 \\left\\langle \\bar{u} \\left|u_{hi}\\right|^2\\right\\rangle$ : sediment stirred up by short waves and transported by the mean current\n",
    "* $\\left\\langle u_{hi} \\left|u_{hi}\\right|^2\\right\\rangle$ :  sediment stirred up by short waves and transported by the high-frequency waves\n",
    "* $3 \\left\\langle u_{lo} \\left|u_{hi}\\right|^2\\right\\rangle$ : sediment stirred up by short waves and transported by the low-frequency waves \n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the velocity moments can be directly measured in a flume or computed, or a combination of the two, which is what Roelvink and Stive (1989) did to obtain the results of Figure 7.21 in the book. In quite some quasi-steady sediment transport formulations, one can recognize the velocity moments. For instance, have a look at Eqs. 6.48a and 6.48b in the textbook. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to derive an equilibrium profile mathematically by balancing onshore and offshore terms. Bowen (1980) does this analytically for the middle and lower shoreface by balancing onshore transport by short waves and offshore transport by gravity."

    "For the present exercise, we are interested in Figure 7.21 and how it changes for different wave conditions and bathymetry. However, we are limited by the lack of direct observations. [Tinker et al (2009)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csr.2009.03.011) present a solution. They performed a large number of suspended transport measurements close to the bed (in the bottom 15 cm) and fitted a shape function for transport due to both mean and oscillatory flow in the surf/shoaling zone. In addition, they determined shape functions for onshore and offshore transport in the swash/inner surf zone. Though the paper is very interesting (and we definitely recommend checking it out), you are not required to know it for this exercise and for Coastal Systems. You will hear more about it in the Coastal module as well, should you choose it!\n",

    "Before getting into the Tinker shape functions, let's first have a look at Figure 7.21 from the book. As said, we use the velocity moments as a proxy for sediment transport. The total transport can then be seen to consist of multiple gross contributions. For instance, the upper panel of Figure 7.21 gives the total third odd moment as well its three components given by the right-hand side of the above equation. \n"

    "## Define shape functions\n",
    "Below the shape functions by [Tinker et al (2009)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csr.2009.03.011) are defined. These shape functions define transport as positive in onshore direction. They differentiate between transport in the surf/shoaling zone, and the swash/(inner) surf zone. Transport in the surf/shoaling zone was separated in a mean and oscillatory transport (or flux), and transport in the swash/surf zone in an onshore and offshore component. This means that in the surf/shoaling zone, both high- and low-frequency waves are combined in the 'oscillatory' component. You should be familiar with the concept of mean transport (as a result of undertow) and oscillatory transport (resulting from high- and low-frequency waves) in the shoaling and surf zone. The main difference with Figure 7.21 from the book is that long and short waves are not considered separately by Tinker et al.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the onshore and offshore transport for the swash/inner surf zone are newly introduced here. The transport in the swash zone can be quite important, but it is not easy to model and it is therefore not always taken into account in models. Also, the study of Roelvink and Stive (figure 7.21) did not take the swash zone into account. The swash transport is also outside the scope of Coastal Systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "By definition, the onshore transport component of the swash /inner surf zone is always positive (i.e. onshore), whereas the offshore transport component is always negative. The onshore transport occurs under all conditions and is confined to very shallow water, whereas the offshore component only occurs during high-energy conditions and takes place a bit further offshore in the inner surf zone (but still in the swash/inner surf zone). Herewith, During high-energy conditions, the offshore transport function helps explain rapid erosion in the outer swash/inner surf zone during high-energy conditions, by pulling the offshore transport maximum shorewards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, these shape functions represent suspended sediment transport only. Measurements were made at various heights above the bed (in the bottom 15 cm). The measurements by Tinker et al. were done at Sennen Cove, Cornwall, UK. For some context, the mean spring tidal range (MSTR) at this site is 5.3 m, which makes this a macrotidal system. The average significant wave height is 1.4 m, and the median grain size is 0.7 mm. This is quite coarse sediment (when compared to for instance the Dutch coast), so we can expect a quite steep bed profile. This bed profile is discussed further below.\n",

Use this value. \n",

This is a nice example of the effect of the tide on which part of the profile is under wave attack. \n",

We see an offshore mean transport due to undertow in the surf zone (and a little bit outside) and an onshore oscillatory transport in the shoaling zone and surf zone. This gives a total transport with an offshore maximum in the surf zone and an onshore maximum near the breakpoint (just outside the breakpoint). These maxima separate the regions of accretion and erosion. The largest changes are in the surf zone, where sediment is moved from higher to lower portions of the profile. But sediment is also brought from the shoaling zone to the accretion zone in the outer part of the surf zone.  \n",

    "\n",
    "It is a nice additional exercise to now select the Scheldt flume profile and see how the shape functions behave for the situation as in Figure 7.21. Set the water level slider at the reference level and choose the $h_b$, such that it gives you the surf zone width that you estimated in Q5 above.  What do you learn from this comparison? Because the Scheldt flume is a small-scale facility and not at full size, the value for $h_b$ is very small (≈ 0.3 m). In real life such a value for $h_b$ would represent accretive conditions conditions and the shape functions do indeed give a consistent onshore transport. In the Scheldt flume, however, these waves mimic storm conditions.\n",

    "A key feature of the two shape functions is that both the mean and oscillatory sediment ﬂuxes increase with $h_b$, but that the offshore-directed mean ﬂux increases faster than the onshore-directed oscillatory ﬂux. For small $h_b$, the net transport is onshore regardless of $h/h_b$. For  larger $h_b$, the transport has an offshore transport peak in the surf zone and an onshore transport peak close to the breakpoint. Use the $h_b$ slider to verify these conclusions.

    "Using this plot it is much easier to explore the effect of $h_b$. We will not ask any questions about this plot yet, but see if you can verify some of the key features of the shape functions. For this, you can have a look at the following pointers:\n",
    "- both the mean and oscillatory sediment ﬂuxes increase with $h_b$.\n",
    "- the offshore-directed mean ﬂux increases faster than the onshore-directed oscillatory ﬂux.\n",
    "- for small $h_b$, the net transport is onshore regardless of $h/h_b$.\n",
    "- for  larger $h_b$, the transport has an offshore transport peak in the surf zone and an onshore transport peak close to the breakpoint.\n",
    "- the onshore and offshore net transport peaks are approximately equal in magnitude for $h_b$ = 1.7 m.\n",
    "- the low-energy shape function can lead to the development of the typical summer/calm proﬁle and drive onshore bar migration.\n",
