    "$$\n",
    "Each of these terms is fully explained in the book (so you should definitly read up on this), but in short, each of these terms refers to the following process:\n",

    "* $3 \\left\\langle u_{lo} \\left|u_{hi}\\right|^2\\right\\rangle$ : transport related to low-frequency waves (stirred up by short waves)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the velocity moments can be directly measured in a flume, which is what Roelvink and Stive (1989) did. In quasi-steady sediment transport formulations, one can recognize the velocity moments. For instance, have a look at Eqs. 6.48a and 6.48b in this book. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to derive an equillibrium profile mathematically by balancing onshore and offshore terms. Bowen (1980) does this analytically for the middle and lower shoreface by balancing onshore transport by short waves and and offshore transport by gravity."
