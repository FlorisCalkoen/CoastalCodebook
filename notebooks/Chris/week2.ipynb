    "The water depth can sometimes influence the wave propagation speed, as we have seen in the previous question. There are two types of exceptions, namely deep water and shallow water. In deep water is the depth so large that the orbital velocities of the wave do not reach the bottom and no interaction between the waves and the bed is possible. In this case, the wave celerity is only affected by the wave period. The other extreme is in shallow water, where only the water depth influences the wave celerity, and the wave period is irrelevant. This can lead to waves with the same celerity (non-dispersive waves) even though they have different characteristics. Both of these waves should meet the requirements for shallow water conditions. In other words, although both waves are in the same location, one of them can be in shallow water while the other is not, which results in that both waves have a different celerity. \n",

    "You check the wavelength and celerity for 3 wave components in the cross-shore direction in the interactive graph below. At the deep water location is the wave celerity constant, then the wave celerity decreases in the intermediate water depth. In one section of the graphs, the celerity for all 3 wave components is equal, which indicates that all the 3 wave components experience shallow water. "
