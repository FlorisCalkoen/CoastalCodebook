# Notebook overview

- 1_coastal_classification: on tectonic and process-based classification of coasts
- 2a_pre_knowledge_waves: to test your knowledge on the dispersion relationship, not needed if you master your Waves course material
- 2b_wave_dispersion_and_grouping: practice a bit more with wave dispersion and study wave grouping (largely known from Waves, repeated in this week's lectures)
- 2c_theory_equilibrium_tide: a review of the origin of the tide (differential pull of the sun and moon) as discussed in this week's reading material and lectures, handy if you find this a difficult topic
- 2d_tidal_constituents: to get to know the tide, tidal propagation and tidal constituents
