# Welcome to Coastal Codebook 

This Coastal Dynamics Open Codebook contains interactive exercises that cover material of the [Coastal Dynamics Open Textbook](https://textbooks.open.tudelft.nl/textbooks/catalog/book/37). The interactive exercises of the Coastal Codebook aim at helping the students to reflect on the textbook material and better understand difficult topics. 

At TU Delft, The Coastal Textbook and Coastal Codebook supplement the MSc course Coastal and Estuarine Systems (CIEM3110-U1). This course discusses the interrelation between physical wave, flow, and sediment transport phenomena and the resulting morphodynamics of a wide variety of coastal systems. The objective is to provide insights into the phenomenological and theoretical as well as applied aspects for civil engineering MSc students.
