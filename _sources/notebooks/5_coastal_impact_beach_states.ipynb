    "## Coastal classification\n",
    "As you know from chapter 2 of the book and the week 1 notebook, coasts can be classified based on tectonics and processes. In this notebook we will look at different Brazilian coastal systems, and try to classify them. Let's start with loading the dataset with data for the Brazilian coastline. This dataset contains the significant wave height (Hs), the peak period (T), the mean tidal range (MTR), the shoreface slope, and other useful values for different coordinates along the Brazilian coast. This dataset is adapted from:\n",
    "* Athanasiou et al. (2023) -- https://zenodo.org/records/8200200\n",
    "* Klein et al. (2016) -- https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-30394-9\n",
    "* Matias et al. (2009) -- https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235951526_Sediment_Dynamics_of_Barriers_with_Frequent_Overwash\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, the first source is used to get values for Hs, T and MTR. The second source is used to get the RTR, D and the beachface slope for the Santa Catarina, Maranhao, and Rio de Janeiro provinces. The third source is used to get the RTR, D and the beachface slope for the Rio de Janeiro province.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this dataset is aggregated from multiple sources, the accuracy of its content at a local scale should be critically interpreted. Athanasiou et al. (2023) for example use a numerical model to compute offshore wave data, whereas Klein et al. (2009) use direct measurements. All of this is to say that this data is not presumed to be locally accurate. However, in this context, we use it to compare the Brazilian coastline on a larger regional scale and draw broad conclusions to illustrate the concepts introduced in this course."

    "## Beach states\n",
    "For this section, we will focus on the wave-dominated coastal sections (i.e. the coastal sections from the Rio de Janeiro and Santa Catarina coastline). From section 7.3 of the book, you know that a wave-dominated system may be classified as reflective or dissipative, or an intermediate state in between. Note that there is a broad spectrum of intermediate beach states. In this notebook we will not look at this in detail and make some broad generalizations. For instance, we call  higher intermediate states “more dissipative” and lower intermediate states “more reflective”. \\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "A common classifier used besides the Iribarren number is the dimensionless fall velocity, which is calculated as follows: \\\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Omega = \\frac{H_b}{w_s T}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $H_b$ is the wave height at breaking, $T$ is the wave period and $w_s$ is the fall velocity. \\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "**Note** that the coastal sections considered as wave-dominated here all have a relative tidal range of lower than 3.\\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "Klein et al. (2005) use beach slope and sediment size as a proxy for classifying wave-dominated systems, see also Figure 7.10 in the book. Let's try this for ourselves! We should note that we have looked at regional values for the sediment size, and the beachface slope. Therefore some of the coastal systems from the Brazilian coast plot have equal values for the sediment size and beachface slope. This is also the likely reason that we don't really see any reflective beaches, at least with respect to the data. Note that different coastal sections might still have varying dimensionless fall velocity, even if they are within the same region. Think about why this is the case.\n",
