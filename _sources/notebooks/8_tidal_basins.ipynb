    "\n",
    "In chapter 9 of the [Coastal Dynamics Open Textbook](https://textbooks.open.tudelft.nl/textbooks/catalog/view/37/92/383-1), we learned about tidal inlets and their stability. Tidal inlets are very dynamic and their stability depends on a lot of factors. Escoffier was the first to study the stability of tidal inlets. More specifically, he studied the cross-sectional area of tidal inlets as they change throughout the tidal cycle. From his studies, Escoffier developed the now well-known Escoffier curve. In this notebook we will use an interactive approach to better understand the Escoffier curve. Afterwards you are tasked to answer some questions to verify your knowledge on the topic.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The process that leads to the Escoffier curve is explained in the book. In this notebook we provide a short visualisation, see the interactive plot below. We start with an imaginary channel cross-section that is very small, close to point A, such that the tidal difference in the estuary is smaller than the tidal range. Increasing the cross-section ($A_e$) results in an increase of the tidal prism ($P$) so large that $u_e$ increases too (recall eq. 9.5). At some point the tidal difference in the estuary is equal to the tidal range and we reach the peak of the closure curve. A larger cross-section now reduces $u_e$ as $P$ remains constant (again, recall eq. 9.5)."

When a change occurs, the system may shift to a new equilibrium and result in a supply or demand of sediment. That relative supply or demand will determine the impact on the rest of the coastal system. \n",

The figure (without interventions) is shown also below. We are going to try to reproduce the interventions made in Figure 9.35.   \n",
