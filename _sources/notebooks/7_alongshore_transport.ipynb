We will use a version here which uses deep-water values for the wave height and wave angle (Equation 8.10 in the book). This formula, which is applicable for straight, parallel depth contours, is defined as:\n",

The corresponding value for $K$ is given by $K_{rms} \\approx 0.7$. We further use a porosity $p = 0.4$ and relative density $s = 2.65$. We use $\\gamma = H_{rms,b}/h_b = 0.8$.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might notice that, given the offshore wave height, the only variables left in the CERC formula are the wave celerity at breaking $c_b$ and the offshore wave angle $\\phi_0$. Starting from our values for $H_0$ and $T$, we can use linear wave theory to compute values for $c_b$ as a function of $\\phi_0$. The computation procedure is described in Example 8.1 in the book. The function below takes care of this computation. Each step in the function is explained and it is instructive to see if you can follow the function step-by-step. The result of the function is $c_b$ for a certain deep water wave angle of incidence $\\phi_0$. Once $c_b$ is known, we can compute the transport $S$. Note that the function also outputs $\\phi_b$.\n",
