The second part elaborates on how these questions are built and gives insight into the encountered problems, the choices that are made, and what alternatives are available. The third section shows results from the previous studies, done with IPY widgets and also uses dictionaries to set up questions.

    "It can become a challenge to manage all the parameters/widgets when functions are used. All the parameters (or variables in Python terminology) have to be defined in the function and described when the function is called. Especially when a list of widgets is used for various numerical questions that have various answers and graphs are plotted with the recent values. A workaround is to store the values of the local - or global-defined parameters into a single parameter that is given to a function. This parameter should then be unpacked or looked up in the function to make the calculation possible. Globals() are the parameters that are previous defined outside functions. Parameters that are defined inside functions are only local valid/stored, and are described with locals()."

One solution can be to give students a tool that does the calculation for them. So students have to give the input parameters and they immediately get the answer. The request for students is to do the calculation themself once. They can compare their answer with the tool or an answer to a specific question. <br>\n",
